	<li>Photoshop/Onsite Technician</li>	
			<ui>For about 3 years I held 4 clients that I would do photobooth overlays for in photoshop. Average about $500 a month in side income. During these 3 years I also did onsite branding and market country wide and would travel and do my side work on the road or at home. I would run small brand ambassador teams at high profile events as well as product launches. One of my main duties when on events was to act as the onsite technician for the Superbooth Photobooth. I learned enough about the owners coding to run these photobooths to trouble shoot and alter code for certain events.</ui>
